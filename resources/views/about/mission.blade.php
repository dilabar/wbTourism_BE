                <p class="text3"><em><strong>"Banglar mati, Banglar jol"</strong></em>....West Bengal is one of the most
                    culturally and ethnically diverse states of India. The people of West Bengal inherit their identity
                    and aspiration from the larger Indian mosaic. One can still recapture the colonial era in its relics
                    which survived the state's progressive development.<br>
                    <br>
                    The land of West Bengal has in it intricately woven stories of many bright mornings and dark nights;
                    stories of many civilisations have left their footprints here. Awash in the memory of that rich
                    history and heritage West Bengal boasts of different ethnicities, cultures, religions, people and
                    languages which add to this beautiful landscape. And that is why Deshbandhu Chittaranjan once said -
                    "There is an eternal truth in the soil of Bengal...It is that eternal truth that has been expressed
                    through innumerable changes, evolution and revolutions in Bengal. It is that truth which has
                    proclaimed itself in literature, philosophy, poetry, war, revolution, religion and karma, in
                    ignorance, in unrighteousness, in freedom and in subjection. That is Bengal's life - Bengal's soil
                    and Bengal's water are the external forms of that life."<br><br>
                    West Bengal aims to become preferred tourism and tourism-related investment destination by
                    leveraging its unique geographical setting along with its various tourism-related assets. It will
                    develop the necessary infrastructure and promote tourism in an integrated manner which will not only
                    bring in more investment and further the socio-economic goals of the Government, but also ensure
                    that all these are in conformity with the relevant acts, rules and regulations relating to
                    environmental protection.<br><br>
                    The overall aim is to see that the tourism sector contributes towards improving the quality of life
                    of people in general.
